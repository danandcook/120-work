# This week I setup and established 3 utility applications:

1. Atom (text editor)
2. GIT (version control system)
3. GitHub Desktop (graphical user interface)

## Completing this week's assignment required multiple steps.

  * I learned commands to use in Powershell
  * I initialized git in my directory, and used git to catalogue my commits.
  * I synchronized my GitHub Desktop with my online GitHub repository.

#### I had trouble installing Atom on my PC. However, I was able to solve this by reading the issue posted by my classmates [Here](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding_Fall2017/issues/14 "Issue Link") .

```javascript
var s = "We learned how to write inline code. However I don't know any other languages to utilize this effectively.";
alert(s);
```
  Unfortunately I was unable to offer any assistance to my classmates. I struggled quite a bit with the homework this week, and felt unqualified to help others.
