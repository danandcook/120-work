# HW 8
I really enjoyed how open this week's assignment was. It gave me the chance to mess around and tinker with different functions.

I felt like learned a lot in the past month. So I tried revamping an older project I did from week 5 [HERE](https://danandcook.github.io/120-work/hw-5/).
I tried to take that concept and push it a bit further. Combining arrays and movement loops, works far better than the single conditional I used in the old assignment. I also added some constraints on the spaceship parts to give it the illusion that it's moving from side to side. But, I'm not sure it looks very convincing. 

I only ran into a few issues this week. I struggled the most with arrays, and just wrapping my head around them. Getting array loops to move was also big challenge. In the end I was able to fix most of the problems I had.
