# hw-5 Response

This week went ok.

I learned some new p5 animation variables. How to create my own p5 variables, and the rules for naming those. I learned about the drawing framerate, and how to change it. And I learned how to use a mouse cursor as a changing variable.

This was probably the most challenging assignment we've had yet. I'm still a novice at creating still images in p5. So making those images move was very difficult. However, I did have a lot of fun learning this stuff. I especially enjoyed the live mouse responce variables. That interactive element feels very engaging.

The functions that I had the most trouble with were conditionals. The "if _ then _" statements are tough to wrap your head around. Conditionals rely heavily on variables. So I spent a ton of time creating the right variables and applying them to the correct conditions.
