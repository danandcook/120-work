# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

First, all the global variables are declared. "var ball" is declared an object with multiple nested variables.
Second, the sketch is set up with canvas parameters and background.
Third, ball.x and ball.y equations are defined to be later used in ball movement operations.
Fourth, "if" conditionals tells ball variables how to react at window edge.
Fifth, randomized color variables are defined.
Sixth, ellipse parameters are defined.
Seventh, "mouseIsPressed" conditional causes change in background color.
Eighth, "mousePressed" function causes change in ellipse movement angle, and speed.


## How did you alter the sketch?

I added randomized colors to the ellipse, and had them change frequently. I removed the stroke on the ellipse. I added a background to the draw function, so that the background would be drawn repeatedly. I also changed the drawn background to be slightly transparent, so that the path of the ellipse could still be seen. Then I added a conditional to change the background between black and white when the mouse is pressed.
