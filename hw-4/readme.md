This week was pretty fun.
I learned how to draw with p5 commands. How to color different objects. And how to layer different objects depending on how they are ordered.

I was really excited to finally work on visual art and graphics. I found it really interesting how closely I had to pay attention to the coordinates of every object. This program really forces you to focus on the simple primitive shapes that make up images.

The biggest issue I ran into this week was just dealing with the js syntax. It has to absolutely precise. One small error breaks the entire thing. But you showed us an effective way of tracking down our errors and correcting them.
