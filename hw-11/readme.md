# HW 11

This week felt like a big step up in complexity. Object oriented programming is clearly an incredibly versatile coding method. However I still struggle to wrap my head around it.
Understanding the constructor was the biggest obstacle for me. But I did eventually figure it out.
I realized after I finished this assignment that most of my projects boil down to "small shapes moving one direction". So I will try to get a little more creative for the next assignment.
