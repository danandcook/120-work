Boy, this week was a toughie.
The heavier focus on mathematics was initially pretty daunting. To be fair, most of the operations we covered used pretty basic arithmetic. But it has been a while since I've had to use any of those skills.

I had a lot of trouble understanding the 'random' functions. I kept having different objects behaving identically to each other. I couldn't figure out how to constrain randomized objects within specific parameters. But half the time objects would just make a B-line for the edge of the window.

When I could get stuff to work, however, I had a ton of fun. I especially enjoyed messing around with noise generators. I tried messing around with conditionals,  but I kind of chickened out once I realized I was in way over my head.

As challenging as this week was. I'm guessing a lot of the operations we learned will be important as we move on.
