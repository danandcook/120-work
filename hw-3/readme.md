# hw-3 Response

This week went pretty well.
I learned how to set up a basic p5 sketch, and preview it via the index page. I also learned how to write comments in js. I found it interesting that js and css use the same syntax for comments. I'm not sure why they are similar though. Do css and js come from a similar origin?

I don't feel that I had much trouble with this week's assignment. I'm relatively familiar with HTML, and the syntax it uses. So I had an easy time working in the index file. Though to be fair, we hardly changed anything in the index.html file this week.

The biggest issue I ran into this week was opening the correct index that corresponded with the js file I was working with. Other than that, I found Atom opened incredibly slowly for me. But, I guessing that's a local problem with my pc.

I really enjoyed learning how to draw shapes and set colors only using code. I think it will be fun to get more complex with those functions. I'm really interested to see how movement or animation is created. Getting objects to interact with eachother sounds pretty exciting too.

## Final Sketch

This is what my final sketch looked like.
