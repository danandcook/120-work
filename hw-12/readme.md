# HW 12

This final week was great. I enjoyed the freedom to create a project that I was interested in.

The interaction between objects was a little difficult to wrap my head around. I also found the use of two separate js files to be a bit confusing. However, I still feel like I was able to absorb a lot of the new subject matter. And I was able to complete the project that I set out to make.

When I look at the semester as a whole, I can tell that I learned a ton about javascript. But, like any field of study, the further I dive into a subject the more I realize how little I understand. There are still many intricacies of javascript that I don't fully understand. That being said however, I feel that I now have a very strong understanding of the foundation and fundamentals of javascript. Fundamentals that will be necessary to learn and progress further in this coding language.
