# HW 10

This week I learned how to create my own custom functions and imbed them within other functions. I also learned to build arrays within custom functions.

This week was important to me because I never knew that I could just create my own functions. I always thought they had to be the set functions that existed within the p5 library. But now I know I can make any function I want.

I have worked with arrays before, so they weren't completely foreign to me.  That said there is still a lot about arrays that I still struggle with. The biggest issue I ran into this week was trying to create a more complex image I could use in an array. I was able to get a simple ellipse to work fine, but I wasn't able to add any more elements to it.
